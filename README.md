#Summarize
Compute quick chunk density, size and skew statistics over SciDB arrays.

#Example
Some spacing was added for quicker readability:
```
$ iquery -naq "store(apply(build(<val:double> [x=1:10000000,1000000,0], random()), val2, iif(x%2=0, 'abc','def'), val3, 0), temp)"

$ iquery -aq "summarize(temp)"
{inst,attid}   att,    count,     bytes, chunks, min_count, avg_count, max_count, min_bytes,   avg_bytes, max_bytes
{0,0}        'all', 10000000, 170002720,     40,   1000000,     1e+06,   1000000,        48, 4.25007e+06,   9000072
```

#Options
Summarize accepts string-style boolean flag options of `per_attribute` and `per_instance` which both default to `0` and can be combined:
```
$ iquery -aq "summarize(temp, 'per_instance=1')"
{inst,attid} att,count,bytes,chunks,min_count,avg_count,max_count,min_bytes,avg_bytes,max_bytes

#Returned Fields
Described as follows:
 * inst (dimension): the logical ID of the instance returning the data
 * attid (dimension): the attribute ID or 0 when returning totals across attributes
 * att: the string attribute name or 'all'
 * count: the total count of non-empty cells - equal across multiple attributes
 * bytes: the total number of used bytes 
 * chunks: the total number of chunks - added up across multiple attributes
 * min/avg/max_count: statistics about the number of non-empty cells in each chunk
 * min/avg/max_bytes: statistics about the sizes of chunks

#Comparison to Other Tools
Summarize is one of several ways to get chunk sizing. We'll list some advantages and disadvantages.
##Advantages:
 * Easy: a memorable keyword and quick access. Easier than `aggregate(filter(list('chunk map'), uaid=...)...,)`
 * Very quick: data is gathered from chunk headers and materialized chunks are not scanned off disk. For very large arrays, `op_count` may take a while and `summarize` will perform much faster.
 * Does not require stored arrays: for example, `summarize(apply(temp, b, random()))` is possible. The user can thus avoid a store operation. However, an implicit materialization - full or partial, depending on the query - still happens as this is executed.
 * Easy to summarize the latest version of an array. `list('chunk map')` is good at describing how much total space an array takes up, but to find the size of the most recent version, the query is much more complicated.
 * Measures exactly the binary size of SciDB's internal RLE format.

##Disadvantages:
 * Does not return compressed size or compression ratio for arrays with additional (`zlib`) compression enabled. You can find that data `list('datastores')` or `list('chunk map')`
 * Does not return other on-disk size overhead for stored arrays (tombstones, free lists, etc are not counted)
